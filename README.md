ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis & Predictions with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to analyze and forecast time series data using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for preparing time series data, identifying patterns, and building a predictive model.

ðŸ“– Key Highlights

Data Exploration:

Analyze time series data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Handle missing values, outliers, and irregularities for clean input.
Model Development:

Apply the ARIMA model to make accurate predictions.
Perform stationarity checks using techniques like the ADF Test.
Tune ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) for optimal model performance.
Visualization:

Plot time series trends, seasonal decomposition, and model predictions.
Compare actual data against predicted values for evaluation.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Explore and preprocess time series data for forecasting tasks.
Apply and optimize the ARIMA model for accurate predictions.
Provide actionable insights based on trends and forecasts.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
